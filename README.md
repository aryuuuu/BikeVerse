# BikeVerse
It is a web-based platform developed to simplify bike rentals for tourists. It helps users easily browse, book, and manage bike rentals online.
 Built the frontend using HTML/CSS for a clean used PHP on the backend to handle bookings, bike listings, and admin tasks through basic CRUD operations. The goal was to create a simple, user-friendly experience for travelers unfamiliar with the area.
